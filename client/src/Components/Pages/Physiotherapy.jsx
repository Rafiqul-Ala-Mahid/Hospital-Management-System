              medicine is a medical specialty that helps people regain bodily
              functions they lost due to medical conditions or injury.
              Rehabilitation can help many bodily functions, including bowel and
              bladder problems, chewing and swallowing, problems thinking or
              reasoning, movement or mobility, speech, and language.Many
              injuries or medical conditions can affect one's ability to
              function, including brain disorders, such as stroke, multiple
              sclerosis or cerebral palsy, brain injury or spinal cord injury,
              long-term (chronic) pain, including back and neck pain, major bone
              or joint surgery, burns, or limb amputation, severe arthritis
              becoming worse over time, severe weakness after recovering from a
              serious illness (such as infection, heart failure or respiratory
              failure). Children may need rehabilitation services for Down
              Syndrome or other genetic disorders, muscular dystrophy or other
              neuromuscular disorders, sensory deprivation disorder,
              intellectual disability or developmental disorders.Rehabilitation
              experts use many tests to evaluate a person's problems and monitor
              their recovery. The goal of rehabilitation therapy is to teach
              people how to take care of themselves as much as possible. The
              focus is often on daily tasks such as eating, bathing, using the
              bathroom and moving from a wheelchair to a bed. Sometimes, the
              goal is more challenging, such as restoring full function to one
              or more parts of the body.United Hospital Physical Medicine and
              Rehabilitation centre specialises in patient-centred care to
              prevent, diagnose, treat and rehabilitate an array of disorders
              and injuries, helping patients regain function, mobility and

              who have pain, weakness, numbness or other functional issues
              stemming from an injury or chronic illness that prevents them from

              in function. Physiatrists specialize in restoring optimal function
              to people with injuries to the muscles, nerves, bones, joints and

              ailments.Physiatrists need to work with other physicians, which
              may include primary care physicians, pulmonologist, neurologist,
              neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons and many others. They treat the
              whole person, not just the problem area.People can have
              rehabilitation in many settings. It often begins while they are
              still in the hospital, recovering from an illness or injury. After
              the person leaves the hospital, treatment may continue at
              hospital's rehabilitation center. Patients are referred to PM&R
              centre if they have significant orthopedic problems, a spinal cord
              injury or severe brain injury from stroke or trauma. A full
